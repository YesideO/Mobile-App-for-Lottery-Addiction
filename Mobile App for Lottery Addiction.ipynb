    "For a good number of people, playing lottery often starts as a fun activity. Yet, for some other people, this activity may grow into a habit that may eventually become an addiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with other people who gamble compulsively, it is not unusual for lottery addicts to start to spend from their savings or loans, accumulate debts from borrowing or develop more desperate traits like theft. \n",
    "\n",
    "A medical institute with the aim to prevent and treat these gambling addictions will like to build a mobile app that helps lottery addicts with better estimates of their winning chances.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are developers who are on standby to build the app, the institute needs us to create the logic of the app and calculate the probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The medical institute will like us to zero in on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and develop functions that wil help users answer these kind of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability that I will win the big prize with just one ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability that I will win the big prize if I play multiple tickets?\n",
    "- What is the probability that I will have at least five winning numbers on just one winning ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this project, the institute will like us to consider historical data from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. [This data set is available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) and contains data for 3,665 drawings made between 1982 and 2018."

    "The way the 6/49 lottery works is that 6 numbers are drawn from 49 numbers ranging from 1 to 49. Each draw is done without a replacement. This means that a number cannot be put back into the set once it has been drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, in writing our code, we will start by writing 2 helper functions that we will be using often:\n",
